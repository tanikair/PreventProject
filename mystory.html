                <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                <p>Abdu is in year 7 and has been subject to bullying in the past. He agreed with Daesh’s views, including their use of violence, and had a strong dislike of Christians. The school referred Abdu to Prevent. Abdu’s online activity involved watching beheading videos. The school felt that he was at risk of being groomed online.</p>
            </div>
        <hr>
            <div class="container">
                <h3>Support Offered</h3>
                <p>The designated safeguarding lead (DSL) attended the Channel panel, taking a proactive approach and engaging with the process. The Channel panel agreed upon an intervention provider to support Abdu. The intervention provider held monthly sessions with Abdu and was able to build a good relationship with him. Other forms of support included going to a youth club, offered through the Youth Service, and the National Citizenship Scheme, which made sure Abdu was less isolated and improved his confidence.</p>

        <hr>
            <div class="container">
                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>Abdu’s first session with his intervention provider was very positive. The intervention provider was able to answer Abdu’s questions about his ideology and satisfy him with the answers. Abdu felt less isolated, partly due to joining the Youth Service and the National Citizenship Service, but also support from the school and his parents. Abdu was very grateful for the support he had received and commented that it had come to him ‘just in time’.</p>

        <div class="container bg-white p-3 my-3 text-dark border">
            <div class="container">
                <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                <p>Brian was seen accessing inappropriate material on his computer. The teacher in the class saw this and feeling that the material was related to school massacres, shut down the website.The teacher decided to report the incident to their designated safeguarding lead (DSL) of which they sent the referral to Counter Terrorism Police because they had recieve a number of reports from other teachers at his school.</p>

        <hr>
            <div class="container">
                <h3>Support Offered</h3>
                <p>After the initial assessment, the police assessed whether the student would need further support, such as Channel support. The police found no vulnerability or ideological risks that might require Channel support.Although the police did not find any issues relating Prevent, information sharing did confirm that the student may have some mainstream safeguarding vulnerabilities in his home life. The Prevent police then referred the case to the multi-agency safeguarding hub or local equivalent.</p>
            </div>
        <hr>
            <div class="container">
                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>The mainstream safeguarding partner updated the school and they felt reassured that a full Prevent assessment had been completed. Police Prevent officers also gave the school advice about re-referral if they had further concerns in the future.</p>
