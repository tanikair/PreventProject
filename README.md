# Prevent
Prevent is a website and potential organisation that helps in the process of preventing radicalisation and extremism through collaboration with loacl agencies through the resources provided in the site. the long term goal for Prevent is to make a real change in radicalisation numbers in the UK by helping individuals that may be at risk. 

The Prevent site was created with the intention to provide provide clear and accurate information about the prevent strategy that has been put in place by the Government and provide credible resources for community engagement.We aim for users to understand the concept of Prevent and how it aims to counter radicalisation and extremism, as well as understanding what at risk individual's behaviour might look like.

## Testing 


On both mobile and tablet the NavBar confines down into a dropdown toggle. Images and Videos are also sized to fit in relation to the screen sizes on different devices allowing the visuals to be clear on all screens.

Most of the bugs/errors within our code related to Image files not being corrected and missing closing tabs which were easy and quick to solve allowing us to have a fully validated HTML and CSS files.

An interesting bug we have found is that on the My Story page the Heading is cut off for some desktops and others is fully visable.
